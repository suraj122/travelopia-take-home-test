3. `useState` from `React`: This hook is used to manage the state of whether the navigation menu is visible or hidden.

##### Key Features:

1. Branding: The brand name "Travelopia" which is a link to the home page (/ route).

2. Navigation Menu:

  When the close icon is clicked, the navigation menu is hidden.

Functionality:

- The useState hook manages the state of isMenuVisible, which determines whether the navigation menu and user menu are visible or hidden.
- Clicking the menu icon or close icon toggles the isMenuVisible state, thus controlling the visibility of the navigation and user menus.

#### Tailwind CSS Styles Documentation

Tailwind CSS styles written within an SCSS (Sass) file. These styles are structured and categorized for various sections of a web application, including common elements, the banner section, navigations, user menu, and animations.

Common Styles:

- `.common`: This class is applied to a common container for consistent styling across the application used inside `header` and `footer` element . It sets the height to 100px and aligns flex items at the center. Within this container, the `.wrapper` class applies styles for a centered container with a left-to-right flex layout and space between items.

Banner Styles:

- `.banner`: This class is used to set the height of the banner section to a calculated value based on the viewport height minus 200px, creating a responsive and visually engaging banner.

Navigation Styles:

- .`navigations`: This class is applied to navigation lists (<ul>) within the application. It adds left margin to list items (<li>) for spacing.
- .`header_nav`: This class is used for the top navigation menu. Within the `.menu` class, it applies flex layout for larger screens (md:flex), and for screens with a maximum width of 768px, it transitions into an absolute position, occupying the full width and height with specific styling.

User Menu Styles:

- .user-menu: This class is used to style the user menu section. For larger screens, it is initially hidden (md:hidden) but becomes visible with specific styling when the user hovers over the .user element. It adds background color, padding, and shadow to the user menu wrapper.

Animations:

- @keyframes openMenu: This keyframe animation defines the opening animation for the mobile menu. It gradually increases the width and height of the menu container while adjusting opacity for a smooth transition effect.
